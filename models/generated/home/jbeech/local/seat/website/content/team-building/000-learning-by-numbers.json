These introductions set the scene for who your colleagues might be, but very rarely do you find out what people actually know.",
        "In addition to the briefest of introductions, it is hard to guage how experienced people are across a range of tasks. An engineer who's been working for 20 years might not know about basic Linux networking commands such as dig because they've been working on Windows operating systems. Or perhaps a programmer has no understanding of how the .NET interpreter works in comparison to a JVM because they've been working in C++, Rust, and Go.",
