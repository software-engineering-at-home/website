# Components

This project comes with a set of custom components included to help with rapid prototyping.

The intent is for developers to create, modify, and integrate components to suit the needs of the documentation tool.

## Cleanup

To show the **Components** section in the sidebar; just rename this file to (`content/components/README.md`).

To remove the other component preview pages from the search; delete their corresponding markdown (`.md`) files.

## Components Pages

- [Icon Browser](./01-icon-browser.md)
- [Formatting Components](./02-formatting-components.md)
- [Networking Components](./03-networking-components.md)
