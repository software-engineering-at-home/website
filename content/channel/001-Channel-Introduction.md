## 🙋 Who am I?

![Who am I with photo and digital sketch](./diagrams/who-am-i.drawio.svg)

Hi and welcome to the Software Engineering at Home channel. My name is John and I'm a trained Software Engineer who's worked for the past 20 years either as a programmer, developer, or software engineer. I'm passionate about the field of Software Engineering; both from a hobbiest and professional perspective. I think engineering is a great mindset to have and there are lots of topics I'd like to explore through this channel.

Through my career so far I've had chance to work as a programmer, software team lead, delivery manager, and people manager. I've worked across the English speaking world for British, Australian and American companies, and have developed a sense for how big and small organisations work.

Over time I'll be growing the channel with new topics- many of which have been scoped out already as part of the planning for this channel. 

## 📦 Planned Specialisms

![Planned Specialisms for Intro](./diagrams/planned-specialisms-for-intro.drawio.svg)

The types of content I'll be producing on this channel fall into twelve main categories which I'm calling specialisms. Each specialism could be considered a field in itself - and will contain multiple topics.

For this summary; I've grouped the specialisms into three areas:

- Organisations and Project Goals
- Software and Service Architectures
- Programming and Testing

Each specialism contains a number of topics which I've sketched out over in the Software Engineering at Home github pages - over time each topic will end up with a dedicated write up, video, and eventually course material that you can follow at your own pace.

These are all areas I've grown fond of as part of working in the Software Industry over the course of 20 years. As I work through the content production process I'm hoping you'll be along to watch, and read, and ask me questions in the comments.

## 🏢 Organisations & Projects

![Organisations and Project Goals for Intro](./diagrams/organisations-and-project-goals.drawio.svg)

In Organisation and Project goals I've chosen the specialisms of Agile Delivery Practices, Organisational Structures, Service Design, and Team Building. These specialisms will let me explore how teams of people approach shared goals, and how at the personal and interpersonal level you can organise yourself and the way you approach meaningful work.

## 🏭 Software and Service Architectures

![Software and Service Architectures for Intro](./diagrams/software-and-service-architectures.drawio.svg)

In Software and Service Architectures I've chosen the specialisms of Architecture, Cloud Based Infrastructure, Monitoring and Alerts, and the Software Delivery Lifecycle. These specialisms will let me explore how to bring multiple software systems together as a complete and technically valuable product or service. 

## 🧪 Programming and Testing

![Programming and Testing for Intro](./diagrams/programming-and-testing.drawio.svg)

In Programming and Testing I've chosen the specialisms of Computer Science, Programming, Programming Languages, and Software Testing. These specialisms will let me explore the bare metal approaches to instructing computers to do useful work - and help as a foundation to layering the higher level goals of large software systems.
