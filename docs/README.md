## Why

Content to teach the world about software, programming, and engineering topics of interest - to engage with excellence and the distribution of great ideas.

## How

To help put together this knowledge; the [software-engineering-at-home organisation](https://github.com/software-engineering-at-home), has been created as a home for content - such that topics about software, programming, and engineering can be brought together and made available through GitHub, Twitter, and YouTube. 

## What

This website; the Github repository, the YouTube channel, the Twitter page. The content, the users, the feedback you give me!
