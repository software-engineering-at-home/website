# Components

This project comes with a set of custom components included to help with rapid prototyping.

The intent is for developers to create, modify, and integrate components to suit the needs of the documentation tool.

## Cleanup

To hide the **Components** section from the sidebar; just delete this file (`docs/components/README.md`).

To remove the other component preview pages from the search; delete their corresponding markdown (`.md`) files.
